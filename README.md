# Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Project
This project aims to classify bank customers into different segments based on their demographic and transactional data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and KMeans clustering. The segmentation provides insights into customer behavior and supports targeted marketing strategies.

# Project Overview
Objective: To segment bank customers into distinct groups for personalized banking services.
# Techniques Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data visualization and cleaning.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
KMeans clustering for customer segmentation.
**Tools and Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
**Features**
# Exploratory Data Analysis:
Checked for missing and duplicated data.
Visualized data distributions and relationships.
Handled outliers and null values.

# Dimensionality Reduction:
Applied PCA to reduce feature dimensionality while retaining critical information.

# Clustering:
Conducted a knee-elbow analysis to determine optimal clusters.
Used KMeans to segment customers into five groups.

# Results
# Segmentation resulted in the following clusters:
Middle-aged males with professional backgrounds.
Senior males with high account balances.
Young professionals with lower balances and transaction amounts.
Middle-aged professionals with moderate balances.
Similar profiles to Cluster 4.
